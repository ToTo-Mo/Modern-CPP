The Funny Little Woman

A Japanese Fairy Tale

In this Japanese fairy tale, our heroine meets talking statues and hungry monsters as she chases a runaway rice dumpling. The monsters, called oni, are ogres or trolls from Japanese folklore. The Jizo, or guardian statues, try to warn her not to chase her dumpling because the wicked oni live at the end of the road. The oni capture her and make her cook rice for them with a magic paddle that she later uses to escape. You can see the fairy tale “rule of three” when the statues warn the funny little woman. The first statue tells her he saw her dumpling roll by three minutes ago, the second statue saw her dumpling two minutes ago, and the third statue saw her dumpling just a minute ago.

These Jizo statues can be found all over Japan, especially along the sides of roads. In this street view, you can see a long line of these statues. In the Buddhist tradition, Jizo is the guardian of travelers and children, so people often put bibs and hats on the statues. Legend says that if you try to count the Jizo, you’ll never get the same number twice because they disappear and move.
