Cinderella

A French Fairy Tale

Throughout history, cultures all over the world have told “Cinderella” stories about a person treated badly by folks with power, but in the end being rewarded. The earliest known version is from 7 B.C. in ancient Greece, but the most famous version was written in the 1600s by a Frenchman Charles Perrault. He added the magical fairy godmother, pumpkin carriage and glass slippers we know from the fairy tale today. You can also see the “rule of three” with Cinderella and her two stepsisters.

The 1998 movie, "Ever After," sets the Cinderella story at the Château de Hautefort, which is shown here in street view. Charles Perrault was born in Paris and lived his entire life there. Maybe he imagined the buildings that make up the famous art museum, the Louvre, as the setting for the ball where Cinderella meets her prince, because those buildings were once part of the French royal palace.
