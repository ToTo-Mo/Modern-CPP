The Talking Eggs

A Creole Fairy Tale

This story is a retelling of a Creole folktale that probably has its roots in European fairy tales. The Brothers Grimm had a story about two sisters, Snow White and Rose Red. In this story, the sisters are named Rose and Blanche, which is the French word for white. When people immigrated from France to Louisiana, they brought their stories along, and over time changed them to reflect their new home.

In addition to magical eggs that can talk and turn into wonderful or dangerous things, this story also has a mysterious old woman who has interesting animal friends, magical foods and a removable head! In some ways, sheâ€™s like Baba Yaga, a witch from Russian fairy tales, who also lives in the woods or like Strega Nona, with her magic pot. Blanche might remind you a little of Cinderella, too.
